This project is the first of many sequential projects in CST-405 at Grand Canyon University.
This code can be used to parse and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for provided code.
This project makes use of Flex and Bison to generate the lexer and parser used in the code.

To use this software:
1. Ensure you have a Linux distribution installed on your machine.
2. Download this repository.
3. From the Linux Terminal:
  a. Navigate to the directory where the repository was downloaded to.
  b. Run "make this".
4. This will generate the output of the parser and AST for the provided code.
5. To change what code is parsed update the testProg.cmm file with the C-- code you would like to parse. I have currently added a simple code to it to show a clear running of the code 

6. Save testProg.cmm
7. To run this parser with the new code just run "make this" from the terminal.
